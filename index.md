survey and research statistical usage of digital library information,

### Current issues
JNLC addresses current issues related to new governmental policies, such as (i) how to reach sustainable  
subscriptions, (ii) how to manage and produce advanced library services under the recent budget reductions,  
which exceed 5%/year on average.
