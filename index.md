<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
JNLC addresses current issues related to new governmental policies, such as (i) how to reach sustainable  
subscriptions, (ii) how to manage and produce advanced library services under the recent budget reductions,  
which exceed 5%/year on average.  
JNLC understands that research environment is drastically changing in the digital-oriented
